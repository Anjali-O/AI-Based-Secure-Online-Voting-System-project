# AI-Based Secure Voting System

An AI-based secure voting system developed to enhance transparency, authenticity, and security in online elections.  
The system uses face recognition, OTP authentication, and Aadhaar-based verification to prevent fraudulent and duplicate voting.

## Project Overview
The AI-Based Secure Voting System provides a secure digital platform where eligible users can cast their votes online.  
Multiple verification layers are implemented to ensure that only authorized voters can participate and that each voter can vote only once.

## Key Features
- Secure user registration and login
- Face recognition for voter identity verification
- OTP-based authentication for additional security
- Aadhaar-based voter verification (educational/demo purpose)
- One-person one-vote enforcement
- Real-time vote counting
- Admin dashboard for election and user management

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- Artificial Intelligence (Face Recognition)
- OpenCV
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- SQLite / MySQL

## Authentication & Security Layers
- Face recognition to verify voter identity
- OTP verification to confirm user authenticity
- Aadhaar data validation for identity confirmation
- AI-based checks to prevent duplicate or suspicious voting attempts

## Use Cases
- College or university elections
- Organizational or internal voting
- Academic final-year projects
- Research and learning prototypes for secure voting systems

## Project Status
Academic / Internship / Learning Project

## Disclaimer
This project is developed strictly for educational and research purposes.  
Aadhaar verification is implemented only as a demo/simulated validation and is **not connected to any official government database**.
